# Debate

- [If you're still using jsdoc syntax like @ params etc, then you're basically using typescript without any benefits.](https://twitter.com/toddmotto/status/929413949044518913)
- [David K.](https://twitter.com/DavidKPiano/status/1052909749065408512)

```
Me: I think I'm done
JavaScript: Looks good to me
Me: Hope it works
JS: I believe in you
Me: ...
JS: undefined is not a function

Me: I thi--
TypeScript: Nope
Me: What abou--
TS: Wrong
Me: ...
TS: cannot invoke an expression whose type lacks a call signature
```

## Boilerplate

- Need to use JSDoc if no TS results in parity for boilerplate?

## Skip

  > What are its irredeemable qualities in Facebook's eyes?

  > I'm surprised that Flowtype meets those standards considering Typescript exists.

  > At the time flow was started, typescript was in a very different state as it was unusably slow for even medium sized projects and didn’t support nullabity and other basic type features. It got much better over time but now it’s tricky to migrate
