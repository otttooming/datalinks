Data preservation and archiving

- [mholt/timeliner](https://github.com/mholt/timeliner) - All your digital life on a single timeline, stored locally. Timeliner is a personal data aggregation utility. It collects all your digital things from pretty much anywhere and stores them on your own computer, indexes them, and projects them onto a single, unified timeline.
