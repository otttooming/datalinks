# Serverless

- [pulumi/pulumi](https://github.com/pulumi/pulumi) - Define cloud apps and infrastructure in your favorite language and deploy to any cloud - Simply write code in your favorite language and Pulumi automatically provisions and manages your AWS, Azure, Google Cloud Platform, and/or Kubernetes resources, using an infrastructure-as-code approach. Skip the YAML, and use standard language features like loops, functions, classes, and package management that you already know and love.
