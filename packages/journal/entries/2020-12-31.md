Mostly working on getting an hang of Rust ecosystem.
Particularly the YAML structuring and validation for frontmatter parsing in Markdown documents.

Main goal there is to enable a gateway service to be provided that can enable me to build a new portfolio site.
Current implementation is using the Gatsby.js ecosystem but this seems not so perfect solution.
Particularly of the co-location of the code and document structures in the same repository.

Alternatives would be to use a CMS.
Possible considerations would be to use GraphCMS offerings or some form of Netlify.
Cons to this approach are multifold as I would lose control of the data implementation outside of service implementation.

As a bonus, implementing Rust GraphQL service is a productive sideproject for learing the new language basics.
