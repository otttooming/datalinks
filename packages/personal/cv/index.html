        My name is Ott Tooming and I’m a front-end developer with a three-year
        professional work experience. I’ve worked in projects ranging from
        Backbone.js to TypeScript, Redux and React stack. Having found personal
        passion in React development since previous experiences with past
        employers and implementing my own personal hobby projects as well with
        aforementioned implementations I’d like to submit my application to the
        open position at Pipedrive for a front-end developer.
      </p>

      <p class="f1 mb2">
        Looking forward and having a clear perspective from my own experiences
        I’ve always seen myself as being especially curious about the world
        before me. With web technologies, there have always been incredible
        possibilities for taking the most advanced and leading end of
        progressive leaps in knowledge and applying it to something of
        incredible value. The creative possibilities have never ceased to
        impress me and I’ll continuously seek to improve my standing in this
        wave of spectacular momentum by investing myself professionally in
        improving my educational standing and personally with my hobby projects.
      </p>

      <p class="f1 mb2">
        I’ve always valued web technologies endless open possibilities and rapid
        capability to advance. Currently having my interest peaking are GraphQL,
        Prisma and TypeScript, styled-components, testing with Jest/Enzyme, TDD
        and visual regression testing to bring about optimal results in business
        value and robust development.
      </p>

      <p class="f1 mb3">
        I’m hoping that my experiences have brought me so far to make me a
        possible candidate for Pipedrive. Thank you for your time and
        consideration.
